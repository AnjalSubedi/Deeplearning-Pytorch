# Deeplearning-Pytorch

A collection of beginner-friendly deep learning notebooks built with **PyTorch**.  
These projects focus on end-to-end image classification workflows: dataset loading, preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and inference.

## Projects Included

### 1) Potato Disease Classification
**Notebook:** `Potato_disease_classification.ipynb`  
Goal: Classify potato leaf images into disease categories (e.g., healthy vs. common diseases).  
Key skills: image preprocessing, CNN training loop, performance evaluation.

### 2) Tomato Disease Classification
**Notebook:** `Tomato_disease_classification.ipynb`  
Goal: Identify tomato leaf diseases from images using a neural network classifier.  
Key skills: dataset splitting, augmentation, training/validation tracking, prediction.

### 3) Cloud Class Classification
**Notebook:** `cloud_class_classification.ipynb`  
Goal: Classify cloud types from sky/cloud images (multi-class classification).  
Key skills: multi-class loss, accuracy metrics, confusion-matrix-style analysis (if included).
